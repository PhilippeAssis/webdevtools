##Requires:
    Ubuntu 14.04 or higher
    Apache 2.4

##How to use:
###SITES
#####Creating a new site in Apache 2.4:

To create a conf in your apache 2, create a new directory for your project with the site name and add it to your local host, use:

    $ webdev site <site.url> -l

####Removing Site
To remove a website and you host, simply assing a
 
    $ webdev site <site.url> -r -l

If you want to remove the project directory also, use:

    $ webdev site <site.url> -r -l --path

If you want to manually point the way of the project root directory, you must assign the path in the second argument, like this:

    $ webdev site <site.url> <path>
    
You can assign '-l' at any time in your webdev site command. It will cause your order also works with the local host using the automativamente webdev host command.

To prevent the application manipulate the website directories, preventing them to be created if there are no, or removed, you must set the --auto option to 0

    $ webdev site --auto=0  
    
If you need to edit the host ip in creating the site, enter the IP as terceito argument command 'webdev site'

    $ webdev site <site.url> <site.path> <ip>
    
To decompress zip files when creating directories as command 'webdev site', use:

    $ webdev site <site.url> -z <path.zip>


###Using webdev site without creating or removing directories


###HOSTS
####Creating a host
To create or modify a host type

    $ webdev host <site.url> <ip>

####Removing a host
To remove a host type

    $ webdev host <site.url> <ip> -r

For details on the parameter settings for each program Use '-h'

##JOIN
Une content files creating a single file

    $ webdev join <new.filename> <target1> <target2> <...>
    
To set the file type uses '-t <filetype>' if otherwise in default is set to 'js'. This can lead to errors for reasons of automatic comments generated by the program

    $ webdev join <new.filename> <target1> <target2> -t css
    
If you want to use a custom tag comment, use '--comment' for this

    $ webdev join <new.filename> <target1> <target2> -t ctp --comment '//'
    
Add '%s' on your own comment to add automatic content among them:

    $ webdev join <new.filename> <target1> <target2> -t ctp --comment '/* %s */'
    
To unite all given set of extensions files, use ".extension":

    $ webdev join scripts.js myscripts/.js
    
This command attach any file extension 'js' the chosen directory.

To join several files of child directories, use 'R' to activate recursion:

    $ webdev join .js myscripts/.js

This command will join the file extension 'js' the current directory and directories children
        

###Important!
The use of the root (sudo) may be necessary if your user has not permission to edit the contents of the following directories:

    /etc/apache2/site-avaliable
    
    /etc/hosts

In these directories, directory paths chosen for the sites should also be allowed to access, read and edit.
